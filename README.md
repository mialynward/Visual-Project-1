This project utilizes the JavaScript library D3.v4 to illustrate the expected population growth in 50 years of the top 10 countries with the largest population. I found this data set from https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-and-projected-growth-to-2100-by-age-group-young-vs-working-age?time=1950..2030&country=Africa . It was particularly interesting to me because it had over 50 years-worth of data and I was able to select data that went all the way up to 2065. It was also very useful since it had information on every single country, so I was able to Google the top 10 current countries with the most people living in them. With that information I was able to hand pick those 10 countries and plot them with D3. 

Some interesting finds I discovered when I graphed my data on a line graph was that it is projected that China, the number one most populated country in the world, is projected to drop significantly starting in the year 2024 and continue to drop. Another very interesting find is that based on this data set, India, the second most populated country, is going to skyrocket in population and overtake China as the number one most populated country in the world around year 2024! It will be very fascinating to watch this prediction in real time in the very near future.
